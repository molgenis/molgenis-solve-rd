# SolveRD Workshop on Creating Cohorts

**Solve-RD Workshop**: 19 May 2022

## Getting Started

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to create cohorts using the [Discovery Nexus](https://rd.discovery-nexus.org/) platform and the [Molgenis](https://www.molgenis.org/) RD3 database in order to locate gVCF files in the sandbox environment.

To get started, you will need to install the following software.

1. Install R: https://cran.r-project.org/
2. Install RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/

When you have everything install, open the R project and install all packages using the following command.

```r
renv::restore()
```

Then open the `rd3_cohorts_example.Rmd` file.
